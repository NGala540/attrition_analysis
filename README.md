# HR data - attrition analysis

## Project Description

HR analytics helps us interpret organizational data. It finds trends related to 
people in the data and allows HR to take appropriate steps to keep the 
organization running smoothly and profitable. A corporation's attrition is a complex challenge that managers and HR professionals have to deal with.
The project aims to define the key performance indicators and measure 
their impact on attrition.
