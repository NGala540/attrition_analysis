# HR data - attrition analysis

## Project Description

HR analytics helps us interpret organizational data. It finds trends related to 
people in the data and allows HR to take appropriate steps to keep the 
organization running smoothly and profitable. Attrition in a corporation is one 
of the complex challenges that managers and HR professionals have to deal with.
The goal of the project is to define the key performance indicators and measure 
their impact on attrition.
